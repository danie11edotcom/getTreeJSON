# getTreeJSON
This is a simple way to interact with the user profile JSON files on Team Treehouse.

To use this project, navigate into the javascript folder of your current project using your terminal. Once there, paste in the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/salexzee/getTreeJSON.git`

This will clone the project into your javascript folder. Now, link *gitTreeJSON.js* into your HTML page. Make sure you also have jQuery linked before the gitTreeJSON. It should look something like this:

```
	<script src="javascript/jquery.js"></script>
	<script src="javascript/getTreeJSON/getTreeJSON.js"></script>
	<script src="javascript/yourJS.js"></script>
</body>
```
