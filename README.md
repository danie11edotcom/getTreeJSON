# GetTreeJSON

This project was created to help Team Treehouse students deal with the Treehouse API. The Treehouse API allows students to pull their profile information and use it in a variety of ways. Some of the information available: badge count, all badges earned(including the image path), all courses completed, your points in different areas of study(HTML, WordPress, Ruby, etc.) and more. This project is completely free to use. All I ask is that you send me a link to your website so I can see the different and interesting ways this project is being used. Thanks and enjoy!
